# Experimental Solid Servers

The following servers are intended for experimental use and testing of new, unstable instances of a Solid server implementation. There should be no expectation of consistent availability for any server in this list, nor should there be an expectation of reliability or availability of data stored within. Created accounts may be deleted, or corrupted, based on experimental work.

In short, these are made for testing the latest, bleeding edge features and capabilities. Unless that's what you're doing, don't use any of these.
